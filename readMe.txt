# capstone-project MY
For my final project, I am creating a web accounting system for small scale businesses and sole proprietorships in Ghana
To run the system you will need :
WAMP,XAMPP or an SQL Server
Node.js
A web browser from after 2015 with JavaScript enabled

You would need node.js to run this software as The front end was built using React, a Javascript Framework and the backend
was built using Express.js , another javascript Framework.
You would also need an sql server, which can be found in the WAMP or XAMPP application as the database is an  sql database.

Firstly, you should start the sql server
Next, you should import the sql file, "myaccounts.sql" into your sql server.
Next ,using your CLI, change directory to the "my_accounts_api" folder.
Then, install the api's dependencies by running 'npm install' in the my_accounts_api folder
Then you should change directory to the  "frontend' folder
Then you should install the front end by running "npm install" in the 'frontend' folder
then you should run 'node index.js' in the 'my_accounts_api' folder, to start the api from the express server.
then you should run 'npm start' in the 'frontend' folder to  start the react app
