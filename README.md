# capstone-project
For my final project, I am creating a web accounting system for small scale businesses and sole proprietorships in Ghana

You would need node.js to run this software
The front end was built using React
The API was built using Node.js and Express
The database is an  sql database

#Firstly, you should import the database into your sql server
# Next ,  you should should install the api's dependencies by running 'npm install' in the my_accounts_api folder
# Next , you should install the front end by running "npm install" in the frontend folder
#then you should run 'node index.js' in the my_accounts_api folder, to start the api from the express server.
#then you should run 'npm start' in the frontend folder to  start the react app
